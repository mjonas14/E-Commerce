  ## Installation
  The repo requires the developer download dotenv v8.2.0, express v4.17.1, mysql2 v2.1.0 and sequelize v5.21.7. These can all be downloaded from the command line after node.js has been downloaded to the device being used. 

  ## Usage
  Before the application can be used, the user must initiate the database. TO do this simply run "mysql -u root -p" and follow the prompt and enter you password. Thereafter frun the schema.sql in the db folder to remove the previous database (if it exists) and then create a new one. Thereafter, exit the mysql console by running "exit". After this is done we run nodemon server.js to start the appliction. This will start the server and allow the user to see the data, add to it, update it and delete it. All these commands will directly edit the database you created in sql, allowing it to stay live and up to date.
